# PowerShell Rangers - Front End

During our final project at [School of Code](https://www.linkedin.com/school/school-of-code/), our team called “The PowerShell Rangers” created a platform called POW!Agile where you can run agile rituals in a remote setting.

## Our Brief
Our brief was to make it easy as possible to perform Agile rituals in a remote setting. Before trying to offer solutions to our brief, we decided to conduct a market research to find out the impact of moving to remote working and the problems users faced when performing agile rituals. 
We found that over 50% of the teams we asked said that StandUps and Retros were the most difficult rituals to perform remotely.  

## Our Solution
To solve the problems previously mentioned, we created a platform to help teams run well organised and structured remote agile rituals, allowing real-time team collaboration. 
The first tool we created was a **stand-up tool** designed to enhance team video meetings.
We wanted our tools to be available ad-hoc, without the need to register an account. So right from our homepage, you can get started using our tools immediately.

As a user who is new to StandUps, you can review some brief instructions on what a standup is, how long it lasts, what questions are covered, and much more. 
From next section you can choose: how long you want each participant to speak for; how much breather time you need in between each participant and then add the participants.

Once the stand up starts, each user is given their brief time to prepare, before their turn starts. You can also pause, and unpause, but keep in mind that the app will track your pauses. We use this data to learn about user behaviour, adapt longer or shorter standups.
You will also see three cards, helping to guide you through the main questions of the standup:

At this point, as a user, you're given some brief stats, like the total meeting time, as well as the fastest, and slowest participant.
